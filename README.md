# Launch Coders

This repository hosts the Launch Coders platform, a communication and scheduling tool for a volunteer organization offering free Python programming lessons to under-resourced students. This is a website I designed that lets students and teachers of the organization Launch Coders communicate over a shared calendar.

The most current version of the website can be found at [Launch Coders](https://www.launchcoders.org/). (my profile on the team is unfortunately "New List Item" as of now...)

## About

After a period of inactivity post-COVID, Launch Coders was revitalized to reconnect students with coding education. In partnership with local nonprofits and schools, we now engage ~30 weekly students in a peer-to-peer teaching model.

## Setup

```bash
# Clone and navigate to the repo
git clone https://github.com/babelnoah/Launch-Coders.git
cd Launch-Coders

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py

```
